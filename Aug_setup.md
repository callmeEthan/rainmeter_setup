- Top bar (CPU, GPU, Disk) does have flashing effect  
- CPU and GPU temperature bar might need modified to read your tracker (By default they use [CoreTemp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/) and [MSI Afterburner](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/msi-afterburner-beta-download.html)), simply right click skin > Edit skin.
- It will also send a push a notification through the [Push Notification](https://www.deviantart.com/not-finch/art/Push-notification-for-rainmeter-769220224) Skin when the temperature too high (By default it's 70 for CPU and 80 for GPU)

- You can change disk bar letter and title in **Settings.inc** (located next to skin ini file)
- Trash bin also made to send a push notification when empty (Right click skin > Empty bin), this would require Push Notification skin to be active.

- Icon dock will hide itself automatically, Right click skin > Setting file for various options.
- Most the skin are made to work with ColorController skin, ColorController simply read system's aero-color using [SysColor](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=14202) plugin, increase color saturation and value then apply to other skins so the color won't be too dark.
- You can right click the center bar and change between **dark theme** and **light theme**.

- When internet disconnect or connected, it will show a message and flash red, however it have 5-10 seconds delay due to plugin limitation (dismiss false alarm and avoid spamming message).
